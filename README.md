# Fraude (GoTTH)

On a journey to explore the current landscape of frontend stacks, I'm building
a claude-esque UI in various stacks.

This project is using the ["GoTTH" stack](https://github.com/TomDoesTech/GOTTH/)

- Go - Backend
- Tailwind - CSS
- Templ - Templating / UI Components
- HTMX - Interactivity
